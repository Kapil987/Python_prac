## Description

Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language.

## Getting Started

Python is a high-level programming language that makes it easy to learn. Python doesn’t require you to understand the details of the computer in order to develop programs efficiently.

### Dependencies

* An IDE (VScode preferred)
* Windows 7 or higher

### Installing

* Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Executing program

* To execute the source code, you need to convert it to the machine language that the computer can understand. And the Python interpreter turns the source code, line by line, once at a time, into the machine code when the Python program executes.
```
python filename.py
```
