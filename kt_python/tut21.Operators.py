## Arithmetic Operator
# print("10 + 3 is", 10+3)
# print("10 - 3 is", 10-3)
# print("10 * 3 is", 10*3)
# print("10 / 3 is", 10/3)

## Assignment Operator 
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x +=5 # x = x + 5
# print(x)

# Comparison Operator
# i = 5
# print(i <=5)

# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# c = 1
# b = 0
# print("OR = ",a or b)
# print("AND = ",a and b)

## Identity Operators
